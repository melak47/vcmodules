A small toy project that uses my [simple module scanner](https://github.com/melak47/simple-module-scanner) and a little python to compile some C++20 code with modules using MSVC.

### building
Drop the sms.exe in PATH, or in this directory, then run the configure.py script.

Afterwards, you can run `ninja` to compile the libraries and demo executable.
